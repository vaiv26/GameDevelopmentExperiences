## Responsibilities
In this company, I had the privilege of developing a first-person shooter (FPS) multiplayer game entirely from the ground up. Some tasks include:
* Input system allowing for dynamically switching between devices like keyboard/mouse and gamepad controls, using Unreal Engine Input system.
* Planning and setting up of different type of guns and player abilities using SOLID programming in C++ unreal Engine
* Experimenting with different types of Gun spray pattern and recoil over a dedicated server network
* In addition to working on general gameplay and lag compensation I also used AI player Assists for Player Immersiveness.

## Highlight
In a team of 10 ( Designers, Animators, 3D-Artists, 3D-Modellers and Story Writers, Programmers ) showcased our game in Georgia Conference and successfully crossed Alpha Testing Phase.
